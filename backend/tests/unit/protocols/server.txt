Scenario: The server's Frontendconnection event correctly reports whether it has data
Given: A Frontendconnection event object is constructed with default parameters
When: The object is not modified
Then: has_data function returns false
And_When: A new value is set for the time field of the object
Then: has_data function returns true

Scenario: The server receives various input events properly and reports whether event has data
Given: A ReceiveEvent object is constructed with default parameters
When: A new value is set for the time field of the object
Then: has_data function returns true

Scenario: The server receives output event and reports correctly whether event has data
Given: A ReceiveOutputEvent object is constructed with default parameters
When: The object is not modified
Then: has_data function returns false
And_When: The server receives output event with data
Then: has_data function returns true

Scenario: The server sends output event properly and reports whether event has data
Given: A SendOutputEvent object is constructed with default parameters
When: The data is sent via serial
Then: has_data function returns true

Scenario: The make_serial_receive function creates a ReceiveEvent object correctly
Given: The make_serial_receive function
When: The data received from serial is given to the function
Then: A event of type ReceiveEvent is obtained with data received from serial

Scenario: The make_websocket_receive function creates a ReceiveEvent object correctly
Given: The make_websocket_receive function
When: The data received from websocket is given to the function
Then: A event of type ReceiveEvent is obtained with data received from websocket

Scenario: The make_rotary_encoder_receive function creates a ReceiveEvent object correctly
Given: The make_rotary_encoder_receive function
When: The data received from rotary encoder is given to the function
Then: A event of type ReceiveEvent is obtained with data received from rotary encoder

# Filters

Scenario: The receive filter properly transforms input data into an OutputEvent with data
Given: A ReceiveEvent object constructed with data received from serial, websocket, rotary and file
When: The object is given as input to the filter
Then: The output of the filter is a event of type ReceiveOutputEvent with data

Scenario: The send filter properly transforms input data into an OutputEvent with data
Given: A backend OutputEvent object constructed with data 
When: The object is given as input to the filter
Then: The output of the filter is a event of type SendOutputEvent with data
