Scenario: Array: make_array function creates array correctly.
  GIVEN('The make_array function')
   WHEN('an array is created from 8 uint8_t values as input')
      THEN('the value at every index in an array is as expected (0x0f, 0x36, 0x08, 0xff, 0x89, 0x01, 0x80, 0x02)')
      THEN('After the make_array method is called, The max_size method reports size as 8')

   WHEN('an array is created from 3 strings as input parameter')
     THEN('the value of an array at every index  is as expected ("ab", "bc", "cd")')
     THEN('After the make_array method is called, The max_size method reports size as 3')

  WHEN('an array is created from const references of values, 0x02 and 0x0f')
    THEN('the array is as expected at every index [0x02,0x0f]')



  WHEN('an array is created from non- const references and later value of non-const variable is changed')
    THEN('the array is as expected at every index [0x00,0x0c]')


  WHEN('Array values are modified, reference variables change accordingly')
    THEN('After modifying array, values of non-reference variable does not change')
    
Scenario: Empty function on array returns expected results
  GIVEN('empty function')
  WHEN('function empty is used on array (0x02, 0x03, 0x0a) ')
